DEVELOPER INFORMATION
=====================

There is not much to talk about, but as the program uses ANTLR it is widely advised that you learn how to use ANTLRv4 before attempting to modify the parser.

The files: MySQLLexer.g4, and MySQLParser.g4 are the Token and Grammar files for the ANTLR parser. 

The Java command: java -jar antlr-4.5-3-complete.jar /path/to/antlr/file/MySQLLexer.g4 or MySQLParser.g4 will regenerate the parser. If changes are made to the Token or Grammar files, then the changes will not take effect until the parser has been regenerated.

It is advisable to run this command in the source directory (./com/abassi/Team4A/) so that the source files are generated in the correct place.

An ENUM is provided for adding more drivers. In order to add a driver, information must be added to the switch statements in the following places:

getTables()
DescribeTable()
main()

The driver must support JDBC. Obtaining the table and describing tables are usually unique between individual databases, so new code will have to be added on a per-driver basis.
